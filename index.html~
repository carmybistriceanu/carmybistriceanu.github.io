<h1>Learning about Huskies</h1>
<h2>A page devoted to your Husky interests, concerns, and questions.</h2>
<p>Huskies are a beautiful and majestic breed of dog that originate from Siberia. Their thick fur is a natural survival key to protect them from the harsh weather in that enviorment. They are known to be one of the oldest breeds of dogs today and are the 12th most common breed in the world.</p>
<p>Originally their sole purpose was to pull sleds, they were then adapted to be kept in homes. The Husky was first moved from Siberia in 1908 when transported to Alaska to participate in the All-Alaska Sweepstakes, a 408-mile dogsled race. The last Syberian Husky was exported from Syberia in 1930 when borders were closed. Although they changed slightly while living in North America their loving Chukchi tribe roots remain inscribed in their genes. </p> 
<p> Huskies are known to be one of the most intelligent breeds of dog. They're easily trained and have a drive to learn and explore. For this reason they have a high wanderlust potential and tend to escape from confidments. They are capable of jumping fences, slipping collars, breaking chains, and digging their way under a fence.</p>
